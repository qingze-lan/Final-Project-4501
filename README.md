## Part 1
In part 1, we do the following data preprocessing steps:
1. Download the taxi data from 2009-01 to 2015-06 from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission website programmatically.
2. Add a new column to the taxi and uber datasets representing the distance of the trip. We calculate the distance using latitude and longitude of the pick-up location and drop-off location.
3. Load and clean the taxi data, uber data, and the weather data.
